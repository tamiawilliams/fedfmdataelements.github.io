        <h2 class="mt-0">About Federal Financial Management (FFM) Business Data Elements</h2>
        <p>
            The Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Office of Federal
            Financial Management (FIT) is participating in the development of
            government-wide business standards. The goal of this initiative was to identify
            the critical Federal financial management (FFM) business data elements.  These elements have been deem
            mandatory in order to execute an agency’s FFM business capabilities. To complete this, FIT worked
            with a Federal Financial Management Working Group (FMWG) to review and refine
            these Data Elements. FMWG members included representation from the CFO Act
            agencies, OMB, GSA Unified Shared Services Management (USSM) Office, and the
            Department of Treasury.

            The lists on this page contain two types of required financial management data elements:
        </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Select existing data elements defined in either the Data Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS) and the
                Fiscal Service Data Registry (FSDR)
            </li>
            <li>Additional data elements, and associated definitions, required for FFM business capabilities.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 class="mt-0">We have identified 531 FFM Data Elements:</h4>

        <h4 class="mt-0">We are asking the FFM Community to weigh in on the selected data elements:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Are these the correct mandatory FFM data elements?
            </li>
            <li>
                Are the definitions documented accurately communicated (for the 31 data elements defined below only)?
            </li>
            <li>
                Are we missing any elements (please review the all 531 elements before responding)?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The <a href="/data-elements">data elements</a> are grouped by End-to-End Business Process; each short list represents a different
            process. In addition, each End-to-End Business Process will
            have it’s own GitHub issue, which is where you can see the input posted during
            the public input period. Thank you to all who provides input on these data
            elements.
