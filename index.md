        <h2 class="mt-0">About Federal
Financial Management (FFM) Business Data Elements</h2>

        <p>

The
Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Office of Federal
Financial Management (FIT) is participating in the development of
government-wide business standards. The goal of this initiative was to identify
the critical Federal financial management (FFM) business data elements.  These elements have been deem mandatory in
order to execute an agency’s FFM business capabilities. To complete this, FIT worked
with a Federal Financial Management Working Group (FMWG) to review and refine
these Data Elements. FMWG members included representation from the CFO Act
agencies, OMB, GSA Unified Shared Services Management (USSM) Office, and the
Department of Treasury.

<h3 class="mt-0">
The
lists on this page contain two types of required financial management data
elements:</h3>




 1. Select
     existing data elements defined in either the Data Act Information Model
     Schema (DAIMS) and the Fiscal Service Data Registry (FSDR)
 2. Additional
     data elements, and associated definitions, required for FFM business
     capabilities.


<h4 class="mt-0">We have identified 531 FFM
Data Elements:</h4>

92
Elements from the DAIMS  <link to 92

408
Elements from the FSDR  <link to 408

31
Elements and Definitions (see below)

<h4 class="mt-0">We are
asking the FFM Community to weigh in on the selected data elements:</h4>

            Are these the correct mandatory FFM data
elements?

            Are the definitions documented
accurately communicated (for the 31 data elements defined below only)?

            Are we missing any elements (please review the all 531 elements
before responding)?
       <p>The
data elements are grouped by End-to-End Business Process; each short list
represents a different process. In addition, each End-to-End Business Process will
have it’s own GitHub issue, which is where you can see the input posted during
the public input period. Thank you to all who provides input on these data
elements.</p>
